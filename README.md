# Fanless Systems Knowledge Base

## The Fanless Philosophy

Fanless systems prioritize **zero acoustic noise** and **reliability** through passive cooling, eliminating mechanical failure points while creating distraction-free computing environments.

## Repository Structure

### `/chassis/`
Individual chassis reviews with detailed specifications

### `/cooling-solutions/`  
Passive cooling technologies and thermal design

### `/builds/`
Complete fanless build guides and examples

## Key Benefits

- **Silent Operation**: 0 dB at the workspace
- **Reliability**: No mechanical failure points
- **Dust-Free**: No fans = no dust intake
- **Maintenance-Free**: Set and forget
